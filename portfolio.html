        <p>
            Hello, I’m Sparsh – a passionate and driven computer science student with a focus on problem-solving and continuous learning. 
            Currently, I’m building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through C++, and expanding my skills in web development. 
            I enjoy the challenge of coding, always striving to write clean, efficient, and scalable code. I’m deeply curious about technology, and I’m eager to create innovative solutions while growing my expertise in software development. 
            My goal is to blend my technical skills with creativity to build impactful, user-centric applications. Let’s create something amazing together!

                <strong>C++:</strong>
                <p>
                    I have a solid foundation in C++ programming, with experience in both fundamental concepts and practical applications. 
                    I am proficient in the Standard Template Library (STL), enabling me to utilize built-in data structures and algorithms 
                    to solve problems efficiently. My knowledge extends to key C++ features such as conditional statements, loops, and iterations, 
                    which I use to create robust and flexible programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience with pattern-making, basic input/output operations, functions, and pointers, giving me the tools 
                    to write optimized and modular code. Some of the programs I have developed include classic algorithms like Factorial and 
                    Fibonacci, demonstrating my understanding of recursion and iteration techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am continually enhancing my skills, focusing on improving my problem-solving abilities and coding efficiency.

            <li>
                <strong>Python:</strong>
                <p>
                    I am proficient in Python, having studied it extensively in high school. I am comfortable with both the core syntax and 
                    advanced features of the language. I have experience working with the SQLConnector library to connect to databases and 
                    retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I have hands-on experience with popular Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, which I use for data 
                    manipulation and analysis. These tools have allowed me to handle and process large datasets, perform complex data operations, 
                    and generate insightful analyses with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am always looking to improve my Python skills, particularly in the areas of data science and machine learning, to stay 
                    updated with industry trends and best practices.
                </p>
            <li>
                <strong>Web development</strong>
                <p>I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in web development.</p>

                <p>I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly web pages and look forward to exploring advanced concepts to enhance my abilities further. With a passion for learning, I am excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.</p>
